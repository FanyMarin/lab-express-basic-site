    <h2>Who Is Paul McCartney?</h2>
    <div class="text">
      Sir Paul McCartney was a member of the Beatles and is still one of  the
      most popular solo performers of all time.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      Paul McCartney was born June 18, 1942, in Liverpool, England. His work as
      a singer/songwriter with the Beatles in the 1960s helped transform popular
      music into a creative, highly commercial art form, with an uncanny ability
      to blend the two. He is also one of the most popular solo performers of
      all 
      time, in terms of both sales of his recordings and attendance at his
      concerts.

    <h2>The Beatles</h2>
    <div class="text">
      In Hamburg, the Beatles recorded their first tracks, garnering the
      attention of Brian 
      Epstein, a music columnist who managed his family’s record store. He went
      to see them 
      perform, knew star power when he saw it, and offered to manage them.
      McCartney missed 
      their first meeting with him, as he had decided to take a bath instead,
      but eventually 
      they all connected and a partnership was born. Epstein refined their look
      and their 
      onstage performance, and worked himself to the bone trying to get them a
      record deal. 
      When producer George Martin signed them to EMI, they had to do one thing:
      replace 
      their drummer. They ultimately settled on Ringo Starr, already popular
      thanks to his 
      work with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Best's fans protested, swearing
      they'd never 
      listen to The Beatles again, but the furor soon faded away as the group
      became 
      increasingly popular. 
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      The impact that the Beatles would ultimately have on '60s popular culture
      is hard to 
      overstate. "Beatlemania" soon gripped the world, and when the group made
      their debut in 
      America, the media dubbed the period of musical crossover between the two
      nations the 
      "British Invasion." This era would have a lasting impact on rock 'n' roll.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      During a decade full of political and social strife, the Beatles expressed
      the broader 
      hopes of their contemporaries for peace, love and rock 'n' roll with a
      little rebellion 
      sprinkled in, in the form of British "cheek." McCartney would write more
      hits for the band 
      than any other member. Songs like "Yesterday," "Hey Jude," "Let It Be,"
      and "Hello, Goodbye" 
      would provide the soundtrack for a generation, with “Yesterday” still the
      most covered 
      Beatles song of all time. 
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      From 1962 to 1970, The Beatles released 12 studio albums. They toured
      constantly until 1966, 
      playing their final show at Candlestick Park in San Francisco on August
      29th. They couldn't
      hear themselves over the roar of hysterical fans, and their music had
      become more complex, 
      making it harder and harder to reproduce the sound without benefit of the
      studio.
